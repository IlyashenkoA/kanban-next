## About The Project

Introducing the Kanban Boardâ€”a project aimed at enhancing task organization and management through a fluid and intuitive interface. Developed with a personal touch, this application seamlessly transitions between light and dark modes, accommodating your preferred working environment.

With the Kanban Board, you're not limited to a static setup. Take control by creating custom boards, each featuring distinct columns that can be color-coded according to your preferences. This visual categorization adds a layer of clarity to your workflow.

Adding new tasks and subtasks becomes a breeze, allowing you to break down complex projects into manageable steps. Harness the power to edit column names and task statuses, ensuring your board adapts to the evolving nature of your projects. Keep a close eye on progress by marking subtasks as completed or pending, fostering a sense of accomplishment.

Moreover, an elegant loading mechanism provides visual feedback, indicating the finalization of various processes. This subtle touch enhances the overall user experience and keeps you informed every step of the way.

The Kanban Board isn't just a task management tool; it's a personal project designed to optimize your workflow, helping you stay organized, focused, and in control. Explore its functionalities and experience a new level of efficiency in your project management journey.
